Located on the banks of the kisiskaciwani-sipiy (also known as the South Saskatchewan River), the University of Saskatchewan is part of a millennia-long tradition of people gathering on these banks to teach, to learn, and to build community.  The College of Arts and Science has committed to increase the proportion of Aboriginal faculty members to at least 15% over the next 10 years, thus reflecting the current demographics of Saskatchewan.  We also commit to supporting these Aboriginal scholars in building community, collaboration, and career success within our College.  This is part of our College’s transformative journey of Indigenization and reconciliation.  We invite interested Aboriginal scholars to be part of that journey.  This year, we will fill at least two positions with Aboriginal scholars. Interviews of qualified candidates and recommendations for appointment will be the responsibility of individual departments within the College.  Applicants, therefore, should indicate the department in which they seek appointment.  Hiring decisions will be based on the applicants’ academic qualifications, record and strengths, along with their potential and willingness to support the strategic priorities of the relevant department and the department’s ability to support the candidate.

Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships for the academic year 2018-19. Fellows devote an academic year in residence at Princeton to research and writing about topics involving human values in public and private life. The program is open to scholars in all disciplines provided their research plans qualify. In recent years fellows have been drawn from fields including philosophy, political theory, literature, history, classics, economics and law, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive. Fellows are expected to reside in or around Princeton and to be active contributors to the intellectual life of the Center. This includes participating in a weekly seminar attended by fellows and Center faculty to discuss work in progress and in various other seminars, colloquia and lectures sponsored by the Center. Fellows enjoy access to Firestone Library and to a wide range of activities throughout the University. Candidates must have a doctorate or equivalent professional degree and a strong record of research publications appropriate to their career stage. Typically Fellows hold faculty positions at other universities or colleges; in exceptional cases we consider applications from independent scholars when there is a high level of scholarly achievement.

The fellowship period extends from September 1 to July 1. Fellows normally receive stipends of up to one-half their academic-year salaries (subject to a minimum and maximum set each fall). Ordinarily their home institutions provide a portion of their salaries in addition to all benefits, although this is not a requirement for appointment.  Stipends for independent scholars will not exceed the maximum for fellows holding appointments elsewhere. The main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:  The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values (see http://uchv.princeton.edu/ for more information); The quality of a candidate’s previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future through teaching and writing; The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment.

Mahindra Humanities Center Postdoctoral Fellowship,Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard University,"Cambridge, Massachusetts","September 6, 2017",1 Month Ago,Open,"Ethnic/Immigration, Humanities, World/Global",Doctorate,65000.00,- Experienced,Fellowship,"Description The Mahindra Humanities Center invites applications for one-year postdoctoral fellowships in connection with the Center’s Andrew W. Mellon Foundation seminar on the topic of migration and the humanities. Migration plays as critical a role in the moral imagination of the humanities as it does in shaping the activist vision of humanitarianism and human rights. Too often, the humanities are summoned merely as witnesses to the spectacle of the significant currents and crises of contemporary life. Literature and the arts are viewed as iconic presences whose primary aesthetic and moral values lie in their illustrative powers of empathy and evocation. Yet the intellectual formation of the humanities—their very conception of the nature of meaning, knowledge, and morals—is deeply resonant with the displacement of values and the revision of norms that shape the transitional and translational narratives of migrant lives. Built around pedagogies of representation and interpretation—textual, visual, digital, political, ethical, ecological, etc.—the humanities engage with the history of shifting relations between cultural expression, historical transition, and political transformation. The ethics of citizenship in our time are defined as much by migration and resettlement as by indigenous belonging, as much by global governance as by national sovereignty. And the humanities play a central role in defining the terms and the territories of cultural citizenship as it creates innovative institutions and identities in the making of a civil society. The migration “crisis” makes it imperative for humanists to reflect on the foundational concepts and values of our disciplines in addressing the representation of others as they are recognized in the norms of cultural citizenship. The issues the seminar will explore include: the ethics of hospitality; modes of cosmopolitanism; negotiation of cultural “differences” under duress; the role played by interpretation and cultural translation in enhancing processes of social integration. We welcome applications from scholars in all fields whose work innovatively engages with migration and the humanities. For 2018-19 we are particularly interested in proposals that engage with migration, cultural memory, and the archive: How do we understand the relationship between cultural memory as personal or collective narrative and the institutional demands of the legal discourse of memory used as a protocol of evidence that establishes the migrant’s claim to refuge, asylum and/or citizenship? What is the relationship between the affective aspects of migrant memory, such as fear, anxiety, humiliation, trauma, hope, and wish fulfillment, and the truth conditions encoded in jurisprudence and political rationality? What are the narrative forms and discursive modes that constitute archives of migration, both contemporary an historical? What are the technologies and politics of these representations? How do archives of migrations function as purveyors of information, systems of classification, conduits of dissemination that create new public knowledge? Terms and Conditions In addition to pursuing their own research projects, fellows will be core participants in the bi-weekly seminar meetings. Other participants will include faculty and graduate students from Harvard and other universities in the region, and occasional visiting speakers. Fellows will be joined at the Center by postdoctoral fellows from Germany, who will be coming as part of a collaboration between the Mahindra Humanities Center and the Volkswagen Foundation. Fellows are expected to be in residence at Harvard for the term of the fellowship. Fellows will receive stipends of $65,000, individual medical insurance, moving assistance of $1,500, and additional research support of $2,500. Application Instructions Please apply using our online application. In addition to biographical and professional information, applicants are asked to submit: 1. A curriculum vitae. 2. A statement of the research project (1,000-3,000 words) that provides a detailed description of what the applicant proposes to do during the fellowship year. 3. One chapter- or article-length writing sample (no longer than 40 pages). 4. Names and contact information of three referees, who will be asked by a system-generated email to upload a letter of recommendation once the candidate’s application has been submitted. Three letters of recommendation are required, and the application is considered complete only when three letters have been received. Recommendations may be those included in the applicant’s placement dossier, but they must specifically address the proposed research project. Letters should be uploaded to the electronic application. Please contact Andrea Volpe with questions about applying for a fellowship.  

						
							
								
								Eligibility and Deadline Information Applicants for 2018-19 fellowships must have received a doctorate or terminal degree in or after May 2015.
